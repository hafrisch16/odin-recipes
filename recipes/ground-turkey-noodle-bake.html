    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A satisfying casserole using ground turkey, egg noodles, and plenty of cheese.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups wide egg noodles</li>
            <li>1 pound ground turkey</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
            <li>4 ounces cream cheese</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8-inch square baking dish.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes; drain.</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in turkey and onion. Cook and stir until turkey mixture is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink, about 10 minutes; drain. Stir in tomato sauce and Italian seasoning; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Combine milk, cream cheese, parsley, and garlic in a small saucepan. Cook and stir over medium heat until cream cheese is melted, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Toss noodles with cream cheese mixture; transfer to prepared baking dish. Top with turkey mixture and sprinkle with mozzarella cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven until cheese is melted, 15 to 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
