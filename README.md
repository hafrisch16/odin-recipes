# odin-recipes
My First Project!
In this project, we're setting up a basic website with recipes.
It won't be visually appealing at first, but will help practice with html.
We are to make an index page with three links to three different recipes we created.
I believe the skills we will demonstrate are the ability to use basic html elements, ordered lists, unordered lists, links, and images.
Here goes nothing!
